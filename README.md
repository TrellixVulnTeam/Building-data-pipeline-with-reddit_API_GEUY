# Building-data-pipeline-with-reddit_API

A data pipeline to extract Reddit data from subreddit r/dataengineering.

## Motivation

This is a personal project based on an interest in Data Engineering and the types of post found on the official subreddit, https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/ It also provided a good opportunity to develop skills and experience in a range of tools. As such, project is more complex than required, utilising terraform,airflow, docker and cloud based technologies like redshift,S3 etc.
